# WEBSITE PROJECT EITH HTML/CSS

SHE CODES PLUS PROGRAM | PERTH AUSTRALIA

Creating our own website challenge using HTML/CSS

## IDEAS
Instead of creating a webpage to introduce myself as a designer or software developer, I created a website with a purpose of providing services to small and medium enterprises, I believe this is the path that I am going to pursue in the future. I feel as an individual, I have so much to offer due to my past 15 years experience in the marketing, mass communication and well-rounded business administration.

## THEME 
Clean design with purple theme is my based. I will endevour to improve the website as time goes by.
